# Jeeves Pipeline — Usage Templates (Operational)

These templates describe **how to use** the Jeeves formal pipeline in practice.
They are operational scripts, not design rationale.

---

## TEMPLATE 1 — Project / Phase Planning Session

**Purpose:** Produce or revise governance artifacts only  
**Outputs:** Phase map, phase charter, or phase checklist  
**Never executes code**

**Use when:** Deciding *what* to do, not *doing it*

### Conversation start
1. Paste **Unified System Prompt**
2. Paste **one planning overlay only**
   - Project-wide checklist rebase **or**
   - Project-to-phase decomposition **or**
   - Phase-level checklist generation

### Rules
- Produce exactly one artifact
- Confirm accuracy
- Explicitly mark output as **LOCKED**
- Do **not** transition into file discovery or execution

### End condition
> Confirmed. Artifact is locked.

**End the conversation.**

---

## TEMPLATE 2 — Execution Session (Happy Path)

**Purpose:** Execute a locked checklist safely  
**Outputs:** Stepwise changes + verification  
**Constraint:** One checklist item per turn

### Phase 1 — Orientation

**Conversation start**
1. Paste **Unified System Prompt**
2. Paste **File Discovery & Access Negotiation Prompt**

**You provide**
- Directory snapshot
- Canonical Phase Charter

**Loop**
- Assistant requests one file
- You provide or deny
- Repeat

**Terminate discovery explicitly**
> File discovery is complete.

(ACCESS_MANIFEST is emitted automatically.)

---

### Phase 2 — Execution Entry

In the **same conversation**:
1. Paste **Checklist Consumption & Stepwise Execution Prompt**
2. Provide:
   - Locked checklist
   - Explicit execution authorization

The system runs the **File Materialization Gate**.

---

### Phase 3 — Comprehension

If eligible:
- Assistant summarizes *only* materialized files
- No changes proposed

You respond:
> Proceed.

---

### Phase 4 — Stepwise Execution

For each checklist item:

Assistant outputs:
- Proposed changes
- Files touched
- Verification instructions
- `WAITING FOR: GO <item-id>`

You respond:
> GO <item-id>

Repeat until complete.

---

### End condition

Checklist completes → closure summary emitted  
**End the conversation.**

---

## TEMPLATE 3 — Execution Session (Blocked / Missing File)

**Use when:** File Materialization Gate returns `eligible: no`

**Assistant**
- Requests exactly one missing file
- Stops

**You choose**
- Provide file → **restart execution session** (recommended)
- Abort execution → end conversation

**Rule:** Missing files require a new execution session.

---

## TEMPLATE 4 — Debug Interlock (MODE 4)

**Use when:** Ambiguity or failure appears mid-execution

**Behavior**
- MODE 2 suspends automatically
- Assistant asks exactly one clarifying question

**You**
- Answer the question only
- Do not replan

Assistant responds:
> MODE 4 RESOLVED — RETURNING TO MODE 2

You confirm:
> GO <current-item-id>

Execution resumes.

---

## TEMPLATE 5 — Emergency Abort / Scope Change

**Abort immediately if**
- Checklist is wrong
- Files outside manifest must change
- You feel tempted to “just tweak something”

**Say**
> Stop. Execution aborted.

**End the conversation.**

Start a new **planning session**.

---

## TEMPLATE 6 — Fast Mental Checklist

Before every session, ask:

1. Am I **planning** or **executing**?
2. Is the checklist **locked**?
3. Do I need files **before** thinking?
4. Would continuing violate an overlay boundary?

If unsure → stop and restart correctly.

---

## Operational Principle

Ending a conversation is not failure.  
It is **protocol compliance**.
